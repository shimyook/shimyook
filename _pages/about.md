I currently work as a postdotroal researcher at the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research focuses on discovering the key processes and interactions between different components of the Earth's climate systems using model hierarchies and observations, e.g., ocean-atmosphere interaction, chemistry-climate interactions, radiation-dynamics interactions, and barotropic/baroclininc annular modes. I also work on implementing influence of gravity wave into the chemistry/aerosol/microphysics modules in global Earth System Model.

For more details on my work see my publications.
