I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. My research focuses on climate variability with an emphasis on using model hierarchies to test hypotheses motivated by observations. e.g., ocean-atmosphere interaction, chemistry-climate interactions, radiation-dynamics interactions, and barotropic/baroclininc annular modes.

For more details on my work see my publications.

For any questions feel free to contact me on simchan.yook@colostate.edu
