I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. My research focuses on discovering the key processes and interactions between different components of the Earth's climate systems using model hierarchies and observations, e.g., ocean-atmosphere interaction, chemistry-climate interactions, radiation-dynamics interactions, and barotropic/baroclininc annular modes.

For more details on my work see my publications.

For any questions feel free to contact me on simchan.yook@colostate.edu
