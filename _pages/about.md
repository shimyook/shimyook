I currently work at the Colordao State University. My research focuses on climate variability using observational analyses and model hierarchies, e.g., ocean-atmosphere interaction, chemistry-climate interactions, radiation-dynamics interactions, and barotropic/baroclininc annular modes.

For more details on my work see my publications.

For any questions feel free to contact me on simchan.yook@colostate.edu
