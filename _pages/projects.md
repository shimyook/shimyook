## Chemistry-Climate Interactions
### <span style="color:gray">Collaborators: Prof. Dave Thompson, Colorado State University; Prof. Susan Solomon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology </span>
* We try to quantify the influencs of chemistry-climate interactions on climate variability. We examine two simulations run on the WACCM4: A “free running” simulation that includes fully coupled chemistry-climate interactions; and a “specified chemistry” version of the model forced with prescribed climatological-mean chemical composition.

## Air-Sea Interactions
### <span style="color:gray">Collaborators: Prof. Dave Thompson, Colorado State University; Dr. Lantao Sun, Colorado State University; Dr. Casey Patrizio, Colorado State University </span>
* We assess the observed lead-lag relations between the atmospheric circulation and western North Pacific SST anomalies in two sets of simulations run on the CESM1: 1) a simulation run on a fully coupled version of CESM1 and 2) a simulation forced with prescribed, time-evolving SST anomalies over the western North Pacific region. I have run simulations with the CAM5 with realistic SST perturbation over the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension region to study the atmospheric response to extratropical SSTs.

## Barotropic/Baroclinic Annular Modes
### <span style="color:gray">Collaborators: Prof. Mike Wallace, University of Washington; Prof. Justin Wettstein, Oregon State University; Prof. Dave Thompson, Colorado State University </span>
* We explore the leading mode of tropospheric variability associated with atmospheric response to eddy momentum flux forcing.

## Atmospheric Persistence
### <span style="color:gray">Collaborators: Prof. Dave Thompson, Colorado State University </span>
* We investigate the physcial mechanism that accounts for persistence of atmospheric temperature anomalies.
